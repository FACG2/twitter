### About the project:
The project is a small twitter look alike site which will allow the user to register if he is not, or login if he is already a member in the site.
Also the user will be able to write, delete and edits his own tweets and view others' tweets.

### The site fulfill the following Requirements:

 1. Login form with 2 fields - username and password
 2. Client-side and server-side validation on login form, including error handling that provides feedback to users
 3. Users only have to log in once (i.e. implement a cookie-based session on login)
 4. Username is visible on each page of the site after logging in
 5. Any user-submitted content should be labelled with the authors username
 6. There should be protected routes and unprotected routes that depend on the user having a cookie or not (or what level of access they have).
